# profile-card-ENG

A tiny static profile card demo built with plain HTML and CSS as part of a BaseCamp exercise.

## What this is

This repository contains a single-page profile card (profile card UI) that demonstrates layout and styling using `index.html`, `style.css`, and an `image/` folder for assets.

## View it locally

The easiest way is to open `index.html` in your browser. For a simple local server (recommended if you use relative paths), run:


## Files

- `index.html` — main HTML file
- `style.css` — styles for the profile card
- `image/` — assets used by the page

## How to edit

Edit `index.html` and `style.css` with your preferred editor. Reload the browser to see changes. Consider using a live-reload extension for faster feedback.
